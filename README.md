# Lab-Booking
This is a modern, responsive web application built using React that allows teachers to seamlessly book labs for academic sessions. The form lets users select a lab category (AI Lab, Database Lab, Apple Lab), choose a date and time slot, and enter a valid user ID. The interface includes dynamic form validation, real-time lab image previews, and a sleek gradient UI. After successful booking, users receive an instant confirmation message. The project is designed with modular components and is ready to be integrated with a backend for full-stack deployment.<img width="1466" height="807" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-11 at 11 44 26 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8af7711e-f230-48c7-a753-3ad48b3a226d" />
